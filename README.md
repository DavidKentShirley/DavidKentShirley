I am currently working on a few independent projects and have completed a few other projects which you should check out if you are interested. Most of my projects are Data Science related and most of my future ones will be to. I am currently learning C++ and working with ML applications with C++. <br>

If you are interested in getting in contact with me my contact information is listed at the bottom of the page.
